It is generally recommended to separate the form edit and form submit view actions in Django for better code organization, maintainability, and flexibility. Here's why: 

## Clarity and Separation of Concerns 
Separating the views makes the purpose of each view clear. One view handles the display of the form with pre-filled data (edit), while the other handles the processing of the submitted data (submit). This separation adheres to the principle of separation of concerns, making the code easier to understand and maintain. 

## Handling Different HTTP Methods 
The edit view typically handles GET requests to display the form, while the submit view handles POST requests to process the submitted data. Separating the views allows you to handle these different HTTP methods appropriately. 

## Avoiding Complex Logic 
Combining both actions in a single view can lead to complex conditional logic to determine whether the request is for displaying the form or processing it. Separating the views simplifies the logic and makes the code more readable. 

## Reusability 
Separating the views allows you to reuse the edit view for other purposes, such as displaying the form in a different context or with different initial data. 

## Example 
Here's an example of how you can separate the edit and submit view actions in Django: 
```python
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect, get_object_or_404
from .models import MyModel
from .forms import MyForm

def my_form_edit(request, pk):
    instance = get_object_or_404(MyModel, pk=pk)
    form = MyForm(instance=instance)
    return render(request, 'my_form.html', {'form': form})

def my_form_submit(request, pk):
    instance = get_object_or_404(MyModel, pk=pk)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = MyForm(request.POST, instance=instance)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('success_url')
    else:
      form = MyForm(instance=instance)
    return render(request, 'my_form.html', {'form': form})
```

In this example, `my_form_edit` handles the display of the form for editing an existing `MyModel` instance, while `my_form_submit` handles the processing of the submitted data. If the request method is not `POST`, it renders the form again, likely with validation errors. This separation makes the code cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to understand.
